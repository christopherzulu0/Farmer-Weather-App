# Date Format Documentation for Farmers Weather App

## Overview

This document explains how date formats are handled in the Farmers Weather App, particularly for crop planting dates. It addresses common questions about date formats and provides guidance for users.

## String Storage for Planting Dates

The `plantingDate` field in the `Crop` model is defined as a `String?` type in the Prisma schema. This approach was chosen for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: String storage eliminates the need for complex date validation and conversion.
2. **Flexibility**: Users can enter dates in any format they prefer.
3. **Reliability**: Avoids issues with date parsing and timezone conversions.
4. **User-friendly**: What the user enters is exactly what gets stored and displayed.

## Date Input Guidelines

While the system now accepts any string input for dates, we recommend the following guidelines for consistency:

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| DD/MM/YYYY | 01/02/2026 | Day/Month/Year with slash separators (standard format) |

## Recommended Format for Users

We recommend users enter dates in the **DD/MM/YYYY** format (e.g., 01/02/2026 for February 1, 2026) for consistency and clarity, but any format is now accepted.

## Technical Implementation

The date handling process is now very simple:

1. Check if the user entered a date (or chose to skip with '0')
2. If a date was entered, store it exactly as provided
3. If the user chose to skip, store null

This approach ensures maximum flexibility and eliminates issues with date validation and conversion.
